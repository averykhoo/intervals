# `MultiInterval` v2 plan

* the range will be the affine extended real numbers along with negative zero, i.e.:
  `[-inf] + (-inf, 0) + [-0, 0] + (0, inf) + [inf]`

## negative zero

* note that while we accept that `-0 == 0`, `-0` will be stored as a separate value, and they interact as follows:
    * `(..., 0)` & `[-0]` will merge to form `(..., -0]`
    * `[0]` & `(-0, ...)` will merge to form `[0, ...)`
    * `(..., -0)` & `[0]` will merge to form `(..., 0]` (but this is somewhat questionable)
    * `[-0]` & `(0, ...)` will **not** merge
    * `[-0]` & `[0]` will merge to form `[-0, 0]`
* we can think of `-0` as a hyperreal number of the form `(0, -1ε)`, while plain `0` is `(0, 0ε)`
* we need `-0` to handle infinities:
    * `(0, inf]/0 == [-inf, -0)/-0 == inf`
    * `[-inf, -0)/0 == (0, inf]/-0 == -inf`
    * `0/0 == -0/-0 == inf * 0 == -inf * -0 == [0, inf]` (raises `IndeterminateResultWarning`)
    * `-0/0 == 0/-0 == -inf * 0 == inf * -0 == [-inf, -0]`(raises `IndeterminateResultWarning`)

maybe this enum, but this introduces a `(-0, ...)` that just feels wrong:

* -3 open end neg zero
* -2 open end
* -1 closed neg zero
* 0 closed
* 1 open start neg zero
* 2 open start

or a simplified version that might be more intuitive, but this introduces a weird symmetry break at `[-0]&(-0,...)` that cannot exist and can never merge, and `(...,-0)&[0]` that merges but introduces a spurious `-0`, so taking the reciprocal now produces a `-inf` that should not have been there:

* -2 open end
* -1 closed neg zero
* 0 closed
* 2 open start
