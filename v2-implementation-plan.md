# `MultiInterval` v2 implementation plan (sketch, 2026-09-23)

companion to `v2-plan.md`. that file says *what*; this one says *in what order*, with an exit
criterion per milestone. review findings that need an owner decision are in section 0 — resolve
them in `v2-plan.md`'s "current design" before the milestone in each row's `blocks` column.

## 0. decisions to settle first (from the 2026-09-23 review)

| # | question | recommended default | blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | closure at infinity: `1/(-1, 0)` is written as `[-inf, -1)`, but the involution claim and `1/[1, inf)` = `(0, 1]` both need the flag to *propagate*: `(-inf, -1)`. state the rule as "±inf are ordinary points; an infinite endpoint is closed iff attained; a pole at a **closed** zero endpoint attains ±inf by the piece's sign". drop the "closure over limits" wording | propagate flags; `1/(-1,0)` = `(-inf,-1)` | M6 |
| D2 | indeterminate corners: `[-inf,-1] * [0]` is written as the entire line, but `1/[-1,0]` already uses the sharp limit-along-the-box rule. the same rule for mul: at an indeterminate corner `(±inf, 0)` the corner contributes `0` if the infinite factor's interval is non-degenerate, and the signed infinity if the zero factor's interval is non-degenerate. so `[-inf]*[0,1]` = `[-inf]`, `[-inf,-1]*[0]` = `[0]`, `[-inf,-1]*[0,1]` = `[-inf,0]`, `[1,inf]/[1,inf]` = `[0,inf]`, all matching 1788 up to closure at inf. general form: an indeterminate corner contributes the limit along each non-degenerate edge that meets it, so for sub at `(inf, inf)` it contributes `-inf` if the minuend is non-degenerate and `+inf` if the subtrahend is (`[inf]-[1,inf]` = `[inf]`, `[1,inf]-[inf]` = `[-inf]`, `[1,inf]-[1,inf]` = entire, as 1788); add at `(inf, -inf)` likewise. a box that *is* the indeterminate point returns `∅` + warning (D7). through the itf1788 adapter's input rule (1788 unbounded → open at inf) the infinite corner is never in the box, so D2 does not change conformance — it only affects user-typed literal `[-inf, …]` bounds | sharp rule | M6 |
| D3 | `int / int` that is not integral: Fraction (exact, per "never rounded") or float (what users expect)? | Fraction; `fmt` prints `1/3`; float only if an operand is float | M6 |
| D4 | infinities for the time layer: v1 stores float unix seconds (loses sub-µs, dodges the question). v2 options: (a) Fraction seconds in the numeric kernel, thin wrapper; (b) native datetime cuts + two sentinel objects that compare below/above everything | (a) — reuses every kernel test unchanged | M8 |
| D5 | modulo scope for v2.0: the v3 work covers A ≥ 0, B > 0 only; Q2 primitive and zero-crossing operands are underived (design notes §4) | ship Q1 via v3, raise `NotImplementedError` elsewhere, Q2 is its own milestone | M7 |
| D6 | constructor default for an infinite bound: `MI(1, inf)` = `[1, inf]` (literal) or `[1, inf)` (1788 reading)? **settled (v2-plan.md current design): literal** — `[a, inf]` and `[a, inf)` are different sets and "a user-typed `[1, inf]` is taken literally". D2 removes the blow-up footgun that made this look open | literal | — |
| D7 | **decided 2026-09-23 by owner**: a box that *is* an indeterminate point (`1/[0]`, `[0]*[inf]`, `[inf]-[inf]`, `[0]/[0]`) returns `∅` + `IndeterminateResultWarning` (was `[-inf] ∪ [inf]` / entire). isotonicity forces it: `[0]` is inside `[-1,0]` and `[0,1]`, so `1/[0] ⊆ [-inf,-1] ∩ [1,inf] = ∅`; `[0]*[inf] ⊆ [0]*[5,inf] ∩ [0,1]*[inf]` = `∅` and `[inf]-[inf] ⊆ [inf]-[1,inf] ∩ [1,inf]-[inf]` = `∅` under D2 (under the current entire-line rule `∅` is allowed, not forced). solvers need isotone ops; matches 1788's empty. cost: `1/(1/[inf])` = `∅`; `1/x` round-trips only on sets with no degenerate piece at `0`, `inf`, `-inf`; the "later" direction tag stays the recovery path. separately, `f(A ∪ B) == f(A) ∪ f(B)` fails for reciprocal with any `1/[0]` (`A=[-1,0)`, `B=[0]`, with D1's flag propagation), so that law is only `⊇` for reciprocal/div | `∅` + warning | M6 |

smaller gaps to write into "current design" while there (no decision needed, just state them):
`Size` needs `__add__` for the tiling tests (the "never computed with" line is too strong);
`TruthSet.certainly` on `{}` is vacuously True and `.possibly` False (say so); `nan` in a
constructor is a `ValueError`; `x[a:b]` restricts to `[a, b]` closed (v1 behaviour) or say
otherwise; the import-time `'ignore'` filter is global mutable state — document that `pytest -W`
and `simplefilter('error')` override it; check itf1788's licence before vendoring its `.itl` files.

## 1. environment and gate

* env exists: `C:/Users/user/anaconda3/envs/intervals/python.exe`, Python 3.13.15, pytest 9.1.1,
  hypothesis 6.167.1, numpy, pandas (measured 2026-09-23; `v2-plan.md`'s size section now records the executed v1
  reproduction)
* gate: `C:/Users/user/anaconda3/envs/intervals/python.exe -m pytest -q` from the repo root. add
  `pyproject.toml` (package metadata, `[tool.pytest.ini_options] testpaths = ["tests"]` and
  `pythonpath = ["."]` so the v1 modules at the root and the `intervals/` package import without
  relying on `python -m` putting cwd on `sys.path`, and a
  `filterwarnings` entry turning the library's own warnings into errors inside the suite once
  the warning classes exist). no CI in this repo today; do not add one in these branches
* v1 files stay in place, untouched, until M10: they are the differential oracle for set ops
  and for `A % scalar`. the package is `intervals/`, so `import multi_interval` (v1) and
  `from intervals import MultiInterval` (v2) coexist

## 2. milestones

each milestone = one branch or one commit series, green gate at the end, sabotage check for
every new property test (flip one comparison, watch red, restore).

### M1 `errors.py` + `cuts.py` (½ day)
* `Side(IntEnum)`, `Cut(NamedTuple)` with `-0.0 → 0.0` in `__new__`, `below(v)`, `above(v)`,
  `mirror(cut)`, `as_start(cut) -> (value, closed)`, `as_end(cut)`, `start_cut(value, closed)`,
  `end_cut(value, closed)`
* the four warning classes and the filter install
* tests: ordering table from the plan, mirror is an involution, `[a,b]` round-trips through
  `start_cut/as_start`, `Cut(-0.0, x) == Cut(0.0, x)` and prints `0.0`

### M2 `kernel.py` (2 days) — the risky one
* `normalize(pairs) -> cuts`: sort, sweep, merge iff `next.start <= cur.end`, drop `start >= end`
* `union`, `intersection` (sweep with a depth counter; `n_overlaps` generalizes v1's `merge`),
  `complement` (prepend/append + role shift), `difference` = `A ∩ ~B`, `symmetric_difference`
* `contains_point`, `is_subset`, `hull`, `pieces` (iterate pairs), `size -> Size(rays, length, points)`
* `Builder`: collect, sort once, sweep (compare.py: bisect-insert for incremental, timsort for bulk)
* tests: hypothesis strategy `cut_tuples()` over int/Fraction/float/±inf; laws `~~A == A`,
  De Morgan, `A ∪ ~A == REALS`, `A ∩ ~A == ∅`, `A - B == A ∩ ~B`, idempotence, commutativity,
  associativity; size tiling `size(A) + size(B) == size(A ∪ B)` for disjoint A, B and the plan's
  table (`[1]`, `[1,2)`, `(1,2)`, `(1,inf]` = `Size(1,-1,0)`); differential vs v1 `union` /
  `intersection` / `difference` on random finite inputs (v1 is trusted there)

### M3 `fmt.py` (½ day)
* `format(cuts)`: v1 grammar (`{}`, bare piece, `{ A , B }`, `[x]`, `inf`); Fraction as `p/q`
* `parse(str)`: v1's three regexes at module level, plus `∪`/`|`/`,` as separators
* tests: round-trip under hypothesis; every v1 doctest string

### M4 `multi_interval.py` — the class (1 day)
* frozen, `__slots__ = ('_cuts',)`; `MultiInterval(start=None, end=None, *, start_closed=True,
  end_closed=True)`, `from_cuts`, `from_pieces`, `parse` (explicit; strings are not coerced)
* `_coerce(other)`: Real → degenerate, MultiInterval → itself, else `NotImplemented`
* dunders: `| & - ^ ~`, `__contains__` (scalar, subset alias), `__getitem__` (slice = restriction),
  `__bool__`, `__eq__/__hash__` structural, `__iter__` over pieces, `__len__` = piece count,
  `__repr__` (fixes v1), `__str__`
* properties ported from v1: `is_empty is_contiguous is_degenerate is_finite is_integral
  is_positive is_negative is_non_negative is_non_positive finite positive negative inf sup
  inf_closed sup_closed degenerate_points hull pieces size`
* dropped from v1 (immutability): `add clear discard pop remove update *_update merge_adjacent
  abs/invert/mirror (mutating forms) expand(inplace=) copy`; `expand(d)` returns a new value
* tests: mostly delegation; `hash`/`==` consistency under hypothesis; `sorted()` uses `sort_key`

### M5 `relations.py` (1 day)
* `TruthSet` (four states, `__bool__` raises on `{}` and `{T,F}`, `.certainly`, `.possibly`)
* pointwise `lt le gt ge` on cut tuples from the operands' extreme cuts (`A < B` is `{T}` iff
  every point of A is below every point of B, `{F}` iff no pair satisfies it, else `{T,F}`,
  `{}` if either operand is empty), then verified by sampling
* `equals_pointwise`, `before after adjoins disjoint overlaps contains within`, `certainly_*` /
  `possibly_*`, `allen(a, b)` on contiguous operands (raise otherwise), `sort_key`
* tests: oracle = enumerate sampled pairs, compare the attained truth set; `[1,2) before [2,3]`
  is `{T}` and `[1,2] before [2,3]` is `{T,F}`; the 13 Allen cases plus the two cut-refined ones

### M6 `applicator.py` + `ops.py` (3 days) — needs D1, D2, D3, D7
* `OpDescriptor(fn, monotone=(dir_x, dir_y) | None, split_points=(...), attained=None,
  rounded=(fn_down, fn_up) | None)`
* `apply_binary(desc, A, B)`: split at descriptor points → for each piece pair, corners on
  `(lo, lo_closed, hi, hi_closed)` treated closed → closure: corner-flag rule when monotone,
  else `desc.attained(v, A, B)` on the full operands → union → normalize. `apply_unary` the same
* indeterminate corner policy per D2, warnings per plan; empty propagation + warning
* ops: `add sub neg mul reciprocal div abs pos`, `pow` with int exponents only (fractional and
  negative-base cases stay `NotImplemented`, as v1); `exp log` via `apply_unary` if cheap, else
  defer to `functions.py`
* `tests/oracles.py`: `sample(A, n)` respecting open/closed, `attained_oracle(op, v, A, B)` for
  int/Fraction operands (promoted from `modulo_v3_prototype.attained`)
* tests: soundness fuzz per op; attainment per endpoint on exact operands; isotonicity
  `A ⊆ B ⇒ f(A) ⊆ f(B)` for every op; `f(A ∪ B) == f(A) ∪ f(B)` for add, sub, neg, abs, mul only,
  and only `⊇` for reciprocal/div (counterexample `A=[-1,0)`, `B=[0]` under D1, see `v2-plan.md` testing);
  `1/(1/A) == A` for every A with no degenerate piece at `0`, `inf` or `-inf`; the plan's worked
  examples as a table (`1/[-1,0]`, `1/[-1,1]`, `1/[1,inf]`, `1/[1,inf)`, `[0,1]*(2,3)` = `[0,3)`,
  `1/[0]` = `∅` and warns); the D2 table once decided
* sabotage: the isotonicity property must go red if `1/[0]` is set back to `[-inf] ∪ [inf]` (the
  hypothesis strategy has to generate degenerate `[0]` inside `[-1,0]` / `[0,1]` often enough)

### M7 `modulo.py` (2 days) — needs D5
* port `modulo_v3_prototype.py` (P1 scalar mod, P2 scalar-mod-interval, far-edge union,
  attainment closure) onto `(lo, lo_closed, hi, hi_closed)` pieces; multi-piece operands test
  attainment against the full operands
* `floordiv = floor ∘ div` with `floor` as an enumerating unary op under a size cap, hull +
  warning above it; `divmod` from the two; `rmod` by symmetry of the entry point
* pass the generating `(edge, k)` into the attainment test (design notes §3c cost) or cap `k`
* tests: prototype's 112-case corner suite and 4000-case fuzz, verbatim; degenerate operands
  table from design notes §3c; differential vs v1 `A % scalar` (trusted); `[1,2) // 1 == [1]`

### M8 `time_interval.py` (1½ days) — needs D4
* `DateTimeInterval`, `TimeDeltaInterval` as thin wrappers over a numeric `MultiInterval` of
  exact seconds (D4a), with the v1 cross-type arithmetic table; keep the end-of-day snapping for
  `date` inputs (document it); fill v1's gaps (`__repr__`, slicing on both, item methods dropped
  with immutability)
* tests: the arithmetic table; pandas round-trips; `[-inf, t]` style open-ended ranges

### M9 `tests/itf1788/` (1½ days)
* vendor a subset of `.itl` files (licence check first), a parser for the used subset (`add`,
  `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `recip`, `neg`, `abs`, set ops, `sqr`/`pow` if implemented), input rule
  (1788 unbounded → open at inf), output rule (closed hull), divergence table as a dict of
  `(op, inputs) -> reason`
* exit: every vector either matches through the adapter or is in the divergence table with a
  reason from the plan's list. `1/[0]` is not a divergence row (both give empty, D7)

### M10 retire v1 (½ day)
* delete `interval.py`, `multi_interval.py`, `time_interval.py`, `compare.py`; keep
  `references/`; README rewritten around the package; `v2-plan.md` "current design" updated for
  every decision changed during the build (D1–D7 outcomes), dated

## 3. order and parallelism

M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5 → M6 → {M7, M8, M9} → M10. M4 depends on M3 (the class's `parse`, `__str__`
and `__repr__` come from `fmt`); M7, M8, M9 are independent after M6. total ≈ 13–14 working days
(the per-milestone sum, 13½). the first shippable point is after M5
(set algebra, formatting, comparisons); arithmetic lands at M6.

## 4. v1 → v2 surface map (for the M10 README and for not forgetting anything)

| v1 | v2 |
|---|---|
| `merge(*args, n_overlaps=)` classmethod, parses strings | `MultiInterval.parse(str)`; `union(*)`; `kernel.overlap_count(cuts_list, n)` |
| `update/intersection_update/...`, `add/discard/pop/remove/clear` | gone (immutable); `Builder` for incremental construction |
| `merge_adjacent(distance=)`, `expand(d, inplace=)` | `expand(d)` pure; no distance rule anywhere (cuts make it exact) |
| `cardinality -> (half_rays, length, half_points)` | `size -> Size(rays, length, points)` |
| `overlapping(or_adjacent=)`, `overlaps` | `relations.overlaps/adjoins`, `A & B` for the overlap itself |
| `__lt__` etc. comparing endpoint lists | pointwise `TruthSet`; `sort_key` for the old structural order |
| `reciprocal` → whole line at zero | split at zero, direction from the sign of the piece |
| `__floordiv__` floors endpoints | `floor ∘ div`, enumerating |
| `apply_monotonic_{unary,binary}_function` | `applicator.apply_{unary,binary}(descriptor, ...)` |
| `INFINITY_IS_NOT_FINITE`, `CONSISTENCY_CHECK` | deleted; `if __debug__` check in the class |
| `interval.py` (`Interval`, `MultipleInterval`) | deleted; `tests/oracles.py` |
